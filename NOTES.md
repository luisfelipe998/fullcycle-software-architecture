# Notes

Following along the full cycle software architecture course.

## Class 1: Types of architecture
Types:
- software: explained in further classes
- solution: explained in further classes
- technological: specialized in a certain tech. May have several technological architects inside the team with knowledge on different techs.
- corporate: Rules and constraints that impacts the company and development environment as a whole. Evaluates costs. Evaluates new techs. Standardizes techs.

## Class 2: Solution architect
Solution architecture: lies between the business and the software areas. Transforms business requirements in software solutions. Designs and represents how to solution will work (C4, UML). Evaluates commercial impacts regaring tech choices. May be envolved in pre-sales and sales stages. Evaluates costs of implementation and deployment.

## Class 3: Software architect
Software architecture: subject of software engineering. Related to software development. Affects the company organizational structure: teams, components. Relation between the business goals and constraints with the components and responsibilities aiming the software evolution over time. 

## Class 4: Software architect role
Roles:
- Transform business requirements into architectural patterns
- Orquestrate communication between devs and domain experts
- Undestand architectural concepts and models to find the best alternative to each challenge
- Support in decision-making under pressure
- Reinforce best practices
- Code reviews

Not all organizations have this role, if not, the dev senionrs and tech leads take over it.

## Class 5: Why learn software architecture
Reasons:
- Navigate between the macro and micro contexts withe ease;
- Undestand which is the best option to solve the problem at hand;
- Think on the long term and sustainability
- Less leaned to adopt market hyped tools
- Design Patterns and best practices
- Understand the software impact on the organization
- Take more confident decisions

## Class 6: Architecture vs Design
Architecture:
- Global scope
- Quality, high level constraints e business goals

Design:
- Local scope
- decisions to a component that are not visible outside of it

## Class 7: Sustainability on day zero
- is expensive
- solves an issue
- needs to pay off with time
- the costs over time have to be lower than the benefits it provides
- needs to follow the business evolution
- every software needs architecture

## Class 8: Software architecture pillars
- Structuring
- Componentization
- Relationship between systems
- Governance

## Class 9: Architectural requirements
How the requirements affects the architecture of the software.

Some categories:
- Performance: response time, throughput
- Data storage: where to store, how to store
- Scalability: horizontal and vertical, auto scalers
- Security: payments, personal data, cryptography
- Legal: compliance if laq
- Audit: logs, how much time store data, ensure security
- Marketing: Metrics about usage to impact users

## Class 10: Architectural features
